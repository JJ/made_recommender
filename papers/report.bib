We then study what makes an entertainment product a ``high quality'' one, and how such quality ultimately relates to product success. Because many entertainment products rely on a storyline, we also take a look at what makes a narrative ``great''---including an examination of whether storyline development can (ever) be automated in the age of big data.",
